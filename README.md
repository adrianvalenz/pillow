# README

This is a small and simple application demonstrating an authorized User performing CRUD operations on users and listings models with an emphasis on test-driven development with MiniTest.

Highlights: Rails 7 app, Sorcery for authentication. 
Very little focused on UI design and UX, more concerned with writing tests, testing validations and user flow, associating models, little to no scaffolding.

This app demonstrates:

- low level setup of authentication with Sorcery: creating custom session controllers and authentication sign in flow

- welcome page is hidden from unauthorized users

- nesting routes that are needed and specifying exceptions

-

application up and running.
